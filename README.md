# Study of Random Graphs and Their Applications in Finance

This repository contains my report completed as part of an introductory econophysics course at Tallinn University of Technology, taken virtually through the EuroTeQ program.

The project focuses on the study of random graph models — specifically Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz — and their applications in finance.  
In particular, it explores how these models can be used to visualize correlations between financial assets and better understand contagion in banking networks.
